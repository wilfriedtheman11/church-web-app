            <p>Every year, we travel to Haiti with a group of young people for a couple of weeks. During our time there, the group works with a medical team from Indiana to provide medical care to some of the locals, and they also participate in a one week church conference with our sister church in Haiti.</p>
            <br />
            <p> The great command of Matthew 28:19-20 tells us to go and make disciple of all nations. This is one of the way that our church chooses to do their part in advancing the Kingdom of God.</p>
